# Mini-Project

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To Predict the House price in future using Data Science and Machine Learning model.

## STEPS
1.First Step is to collect data from dataset.
2.Then some basic Data Science process are to be applied.
3.Then the model is trained using Machine Learning algorithm which in the case using Regression.
4.Based on the generated graphs we predict the cost of the house.
